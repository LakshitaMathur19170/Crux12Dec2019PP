------Recursion------


Recursion is the art of induction - reducing a component 
and breaking it down to smaller and smaller components 
repetitively using the very same logic or function 
to solve each of them.













































Recursion is based on the fact that a function can 
be reused and called within itself to solve a problem 
that can be broken into smaller repetitive small 
incremental and inductive steps in which each one calls 
the same function with a variation of the original 
input until a certain condition is satisfied












    Draw the markings of a typical English ruler. For each inch, 
 we place a tick with a numeric label. We denote the length of the tick designating a whole 
 inch as the major tick length. Between the marks for whole inches, the ruler contains a 
  series of minor ticks, placed at intervals of 1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, and so on. As the size of 
 the interval decreases by half, the tick length decreases by one.
